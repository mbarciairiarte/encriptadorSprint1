Hi! This is my solution for the first Challenge of the Alura's ONE program (Oracle Next Education). This app allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using specific rules

<h2>Rules</h2>

It uses the following predefined rules to encrypt and decrypt messages:

- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"
